# wifi_reconnect_auto_win11
 If you want to automatically reconnect to any wifi network in Windows 11 at regular intervals and this network has two-factor protection (web login + pc wifi password), this program will do the job easily.

This program runs in the terminal. And it should not be closed while running.

While running, the program will open and close the web page quickly in order to log in to the web.

I hope it works for you.
